In the first exercise I tried the PCA(principal component analysis) method to reduce the dimensions of my data.
First I tried the PCA algorithm in a 2Dim to check the fuctionality and then I applied it in a dataset of 5000 pictures.
You can see the results in the .png files or in the report file.

--Soon .png files and report.
