This repository is created for the purposes of the TUC subject with the same name, or TEL311.

  - Exercise 1: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and LDA, Feature extraction using Bayes theorem.
  - Exercise 2: Logistic Reggresion, MLE classification, Support Vector Machines classification.
  - Exercise 3: kNN and NLP, K-means Clustering, GMM using EM vs K-means classification.
  - Exercise 4: Feature Selection, SVM-Classification, Cross Validation, Overfitting, Simple Neural Network, Convolutional NN for image       Recognition.

Language support: Matlab 2018a and Python3.
To run the fashion_CNN download the notebook and then import it in google colab. Then choose to use GPU as hardware for faster results.
